    <h3>building a new pc</h3><br/>
    Since the new RTX3080 is half the price and around ~1.5 times the
    performance of the previous generation of GPUs, Im thinking of
    building a data science rig based on the new GPUs. Im going to wait
    till January until there are enough evidence of working CUDA and
    overheating issues.

    <h3>CppCon 2020</h3>
    Watched panels about the new features in C++20 (insert excited onomatopoeia).
    JIT and better parallelization support in C++20(Woohoo!!!)

    <h3>PYCON 2020, JP</h3>
    Very Happy to see CuPy's improvements, I will play around to check
    the new performance.  Apparently CuPy got better than Pytorch and
    TensorFlow with some tensor operations.  I'll definitly go back to
    my Helly's Code and see if I can add some parallelizations to speed
    up the search

    <h3>Maybe make another ABM in C++ that simulate Covid</h3>
    Following the ABM model in Python, I feel like the performance was
    reaching a limit with just a local machine (Im not paying to run my code on the cloud).
    Python is great with handling abstractions, but with C++ the
    performance would be substancially improved and with the "release"
    of C++20, parallelization and multithreading became easier.
    I had alot of ideas that I couldnt fulfill due to constraints,
    so I might make something intresting.  While I'm at it, I want to
    try test driven coding.
