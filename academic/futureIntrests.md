# My Academic Intrests:

My interests range between Physics, Coding, and Mathematics.  However, what excites me the most are the topics that are in the intersections: [Linnear Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming), Algorithms, Discrete math, and [Computational Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry).

My interest in Linear Programming didn't come from a math class as most would suspect.  It arose from an OR (Operations Research) class that uses excel.  The problems provided by the professor were real problems from the past with interesting problem-solving methods.  The professor concealed many mathematically rigorous ideas, but he would always provide references to the deep underlying math concepts; many of which I knew, but never taught their applications in these optimization problems.

Shoutout to my favorite teachers from Highschool: Mr.C for my liking of Math, Mcrae for Physics, and Morris for coding; although I didn't go the business route, Santos is incredible at teaching business.

Algorithms and Discrete math come from Combinatorics and the Putnam class.  Algorithms were further expanded with the algorithms class and books by Knuth.
